## User Stories
- As a user, I want to save restaurants to a list so that I have a reference if I want to visit again.
- As a user, I want to save menu items I've enjoyed in the past so I always know what to order when I'm not feeling adventurous.
- As a user, I want to leave notes about my favorite restaurants so I can remember why I enjoyed it so much.
- As a user, I want to see a map of exactly where the restaurant is so I can find it easily once I've parked. 
- As a user, I want to edit my notes about restaurants in case my opinion changes.
- As a user, I want to delete restaurants from my list if they are no longer good.
- As a user, I want to make custom categories to sort my favorite restaurants.

## MVP Goals
- Welcome home page that renders login/signup
- User profile page that displays user's saved restaurants
- User will be able to access a details page for each restaurant, which will contain:
	- A note made by user, which can be edited if needed
	- A map of the immediate vicinity of the restaurant
	- Favorite menu items from the restaurant
- User will be able to create custom categories to organize the list of restaurants
	- e.g. "Go-To", "Comfort", "Sushi All-stars", "Too Pricey for Tuesday"

## Stretch Goals
- User created groups to connect to other users (e.g. Family Favorites, Homie Favorites)
- Other user lists (e.g. cafes, bars, dessert spots, etc.)
- Randomized restaurant/menu item picker
- Responsive design for use on mobile
- Display ETA/estimated distance/embedded navigation link
- Ability to add user photos for restaurant or menu items
